# File Size Limits Configuration
#
# Large files consume more tokens when AI assistants read them.
# This check helps identify files that may benefit from refactoring.
#
# Thresholds based on typical codebase analysis:
# - ts: 8KB (95th percentile of typical TypeScript codebases)
# - md: 15KB (90th percentile for documentation)

# Size limits by file extension (in bytes)
limits:
  ts: 8192      # 8KB - TypeScript files
  md: 15360     # 15KB - Markdown files

# Directories to exclude from checking
exclude:
  - node_modules
  - dist
  - build
  - .git
  - coverage
