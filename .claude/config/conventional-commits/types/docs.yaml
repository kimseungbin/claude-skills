# Common mistakes
anti_patterns:
  - wrong: "docs(skills): Add new skill"
    correct: "feat(skills): Add new skill"
    reason: "Adding a skill is a feature, not documentation"

  - wrong: "docs(project): Move content to README"
    correct: "refactor(project): Move content from CLAUDE.md to README"
    reason: "Moving content is restructuring, not documenting"
