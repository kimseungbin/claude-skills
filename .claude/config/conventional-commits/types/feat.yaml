# Common mistakes
anti_patterns:
  - wrong: "feat(docs): Add README"
    correct: "docs(skill-name): Add README"
    reason: "Adding documentation is docs, not feat"

  - wrong: "feat(project): Update CLAUDE.md"
    correct: "docs(project): Update CLAUDE.md"
    reason: "Updating docs is docs type"

  - wrong: "feat(skills): Reorganize skill structure"
    correct: "refactor(skills): Reorganize skill structure"
    reason: "Reorganizing without new capability is refactor"
