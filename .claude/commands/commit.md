Use the `commit-expert` subagent to create git commits following the Conventional Commits specification.

The subagent provides:
- Intelligent multi-commit splitting with smart ordering
- Pattern learning from project's commit history
- Interactive selection for granular control
- Implementation guides for infrastructure/frontend/backend projects
- Context isolation (separate from main conversation)

Alternatively, use `Skill(conventional-commits)` for the legacy skill-based approach.
